* Eric Bachmeier (ebachme@uwo.ca) has contributed to the team as of the Demo 1 deadline by being the team liaison by keeping in contact with the customer / teaching assistant to get the latest project specifications. This involved getting any of the teamâ€™s questions answered promptly. In the first stages of development he worked on the backend design and workflow of our program. Eric worked on parts of the user interface including the publications list, page organization, and tab view in Qt Creator. He also implemented the method to filter the data by year from the drop down boxes.

## Project Description
---

This is a stand-alone app developed in C++ by Team Apple. The purpose of this desktop application is to process faculty data in the form of spreadsheets. The user can then select their parameters whether it be the time frame for the data or the type of publications or research to view. After the data is verified, it can be viewed in formatted charts and graphs.

## Project Tools
---

For the development of this application we used Qt Creator for our cross-platform IDE. 

We used Git for version control and hosted the project on GitHub.

The build automation for this project is done through Qt as well.
